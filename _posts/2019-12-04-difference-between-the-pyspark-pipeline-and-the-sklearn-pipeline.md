The pipeline object in sklearn makes it easy to sequentially apply a list of transforms and a final estimator [1]. This makes it easy to organize models.
PySpark has a similar pipeline API but there are some differences.<!--more-->

1. There are a `.fit()` and `.transform()` method, they work in the same way in sklearn but on the `pyspark.sql.DataFrame`, but there are  no `.predict()` method.
2. You can specify the subset of input features in a pipeline. E.g. you don't have to apply the model to *all* the columns in a dataframe `X` but you can do with a subset.
3. Similar with the response variable can be specified as a column in the dataframe.
4. When predicting you use the `.transform()` method on a fitted model object, which adds extra column(s) based on the model.
5. The input features are `Vector` object, You usually use the `VectorAssembler` in the first step of the pipeline to assemble input features into this object.

Sample code snippet:

```python
from pyspark.ml import Pipeline
from pyspark.ml import PipelineModel
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler
from pyspark.ml.regression import RandomForestRegressor


assembler = VectorAssembler(
    inputCols=feature_cols,
    outputCol="features"
)

rf = RandomForestRegressor(
    featuresCol="features",
    labelCol=response_variable,
    predictionCol="prediction",
    **parameters
)

pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[assembler, rf])
model = pipeline.fit(train)
test_with_predictions = model.predict(test)  # This will add a `prediction` column AND a `features` column to test.

# Save the model for later use.
model.write().overwrite().save('/tmp/my_great_model')

# Load the model later.
model = PipelineModel.load('/tmp/my_great_model')
```

The added `features` column is added from the `VectorAssembler`.
